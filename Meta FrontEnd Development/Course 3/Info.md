Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that is used to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, and provides tools for managing conflicts and merging changes. Git works by creating a local repository on each developer's machine, which contains a complete copy of the codebase and its history. Developers can make changes to the code and commit those changes to their local repository, and then push those changes to a central repository that is shared with other developers.

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a platform for developers to collaborate on code, share their work with others, and contribute to open source projects. GitHub provides tools for managing issues, pull requests, and code reviews, as well as integrations with other tools like continuous integration and deployment services. GitHub also provides social features like following other developers, starring repositories, and contributing to open source projects.

Together, Git and GitHub provide a powerful platform for managing source code and collaborating on software development projects. They are widely used in the software industry and have become an essential tool for developers.
